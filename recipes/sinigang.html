    <h2><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h2>
    <p>
      Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory
      medley of flavors. It's popular comfort food in the Philippines, usually
      served on its own or paired with steamed rice on rainy days to ward off
      the cold. Like adobo, the term sinigang describes a cooking method more
      than a particular dish, as it has many variations. It can be made with
      protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef, and chicken and souring agents
      such as tamarind, guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol,
      and other native fruits.
